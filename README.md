EfiLibrary is a project between the students of Business Information Technology Degree Programme in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, and Eficode Oy, a Finnish company specializing in enhancing software development, whose products are related to automation and devops consulting, as well as accessibility and user studies.

The EfiLibrary project was created and built from the ground up and in its entirety by the students of Haaga-Helia UAS for the use of Eficode Oy.

This digital library project is the transformation of the many physical copies of books owned by Eficode and scattered in different Eficode offices located in 10 different countries around the world, into one digital library in which the various users will be able to learn-from, teach-with, and enjoy sharing knowledge easily and efficiently.

The users will be able to loan, reserve, and return books, create lists of favorite books and watch other users' favorite lists, as well as browse through the library database.

Admins will be able to control the distribution of borrowed books and monitor the users' activity within the library on a restricted admin page. Admin users can view users, books, loans, reservations, and requests. Admin users can also edit and delete users, and generate a password reset link if need be. In addition, admin users can deny, allow, or cancel book requests and reservations in the restricted admin page.

<br/>
Efilibrary consists of a frontend and a backend with a connected relational database. Both front- and backend are written in TypeScript and are using React and Express respectively as their main framework and library.
<br/>
<br/>
The frontend’s user interface is divided into pages that are routed through react-router-dom. To access pages other than the login page or signup page, users can create accounts and securely log in in through HTTPS with passwords that are hashed on server-side. Authentication is implemented using Bearer Tokens.
